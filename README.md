# Spotify Dashboard


## Introduction Statement

An interactive Spotify analytics dashboard in Power BI that visualises key insights from streaming data. It includes metrics like total streams, top artists, most-played tracks, and trends in listening habits over time. The dashboard features bar charts showcasing top tracks and line graphs to display streaming activity over various time periods. I’ve also incorporated filters and slicers, allowing for deeper analysis by date range, artist, or album, offering a clear and data-driven overview of the user's Spotify activity.

A comprehensive method is required to track and analyse streaming habits on Spotify, including total streams, top artists, and most-played tracks over time. Without clear and accessible insights into listening patterns, it becomes difficult to understand trends in music consumption and to optimise playlist curation based on engagement and preferences.
